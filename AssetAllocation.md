# Diversification & Asset Allocation

“_Diversification is the only free lunch [in investing]”_
— Harry Markowitz, 1990 Economics Nobel Prize Winner for his work on portfolio management

## What Is Asset Allocation?

- Asset allocation is the process of allocating money into different types of investments.
- Every investable asset - from art to real estate to stocks to cryptocurrencies - can be categorized into types called **asset classes.**
- This process of allocating money across a broad range of different asset classes is called **diversification.**
- The most common asset classes are stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, and commodities.
- Historically each of these common asset classes has performed in different ways under given market and economic conditions.
- Understanding the relationship between asset classes and their historical performance allows an investor to construct a portfolio that balances risk and reward to meet their personal investment goals.
- Certain assets like crypto or tech stocks might have huge potential upside but also carry substantial risk. Others, like a bond issued by the US government (treasury or t-bill), have limited upside but, even in a massive recession, will likely hold their value.
- If your portfolio were a basketball team, then asset allocation is how you draft your players. A team of 5 exceptional 3-point shooters might be incredibly effective against a certain type of opponent but would be less resilient compared to a team of 5 players with differing and complementary skills. This second team would likely be much more successful against a broad and unknown set of opponents.

## Benefits of Asset Allocation

There are three main benefits of having a diversified asset allocation:

- **Avoiding disaster** - An individual that only invested in a single asset class, stocks, for example, would have seen their portfolio decline by >50% during the last two major stock market crashes in 2000 & 2008. If this same investor had instead allocated a fraction of their stocks to another asset class like bonds or commodities, their portfolios would have declined significantly less and recovered faster.
- **Improving risk-adjusted returns** - investors think about the performance of an asset using a concept called **risk-adjusted return**. Everybody wants higher returns and lower risk! But typically assets that have higher returns also carry higher risk. Through the magic of diversification, it can often be possible to decrease your overall risk while keeping the expected return relatively constant.
- **Preparing for unknown economic circumstances -** It is impossible to predict the future: will there be a global pandemic, will there be 10% inflation, will there be a massive geopolitical conflict, will the federal reserve raise interest rates? However, we can look to history and understand how certain asset classes performed during past economic regimes. Even if the future is uncertain, we can construct a portfolio that has components that perform well regardless of future economic circumstances.

## Asset Allocation and Financial Planning

- Learning about asset allocation will not help you pick the next Tesla or Bitcoin. It is not about finding the most exotic mix of flashy alternative investments. It is simply about structuring your portfolio in such a way as to meet your financial goals and prepare for an unknown future.
- There is no “correct” asset allocation, an allocation for a 22-year-old with an advanced engineering degree and high career earning potential might look very different from a 70-year-old retiree.
  - A young person might choose to allocate 100% of their portfolio to crypto + meme stocks and will be happy to risk an 80% decline to potentially see a 5x gain.
  - An older person who is living off of their retirement savings would likely be much happier in a lower-risk investment that pays interest or dividends to help pay for their living expenses.
- It is important to think about your own financial goals and risk tolerance when establishing a personal asset allocation.

## What are the most common asset classes?

There are several main agreed-upon asset classes, however, these definitions change over time. For example, cryptocurrencies have only existed for ~10 years and are now considered by many to be an independent asset class.

- **Equities** - aka stocks, shares in publicly traded companies worldwide
- **Fixed Income** - aka bonds, an investment that pays a rate of interest over a set period
- **Cash / Foreign currencies -** checking/savings account/CD or money market fund
- **Commodities** - gold, silver, oil, or even things like pork bellies and wheat
- **Real Estate** - buildings or investment properties
- **Cryptocurrencies** - digital assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum

Many of these asset classes are further subdivided into **asset class categories.** For example, equities can be either US or Global, and fixed income investments can be issued by the US government (T-bills) by local governments (Municipal bonds) or corporations (corporate debt). Diversification within an asset class, such as having 70% of your equities from US and 30% from international companies is often advised by financial professionals. However, most of the benefit an investor gets from diversification is due to their overall asset allocation, not from their allocation within an asset class.

## Asset Class Performance

- It is very difficult to predict how an individual stock or bond will perform over time. Even professionals that specialize in predicting asset prices will usually fail to outperform a randomly chosen portfolio.
- It is similarly difficult to predict the performance of an asset class, **however**, we can reliably look at history to understand patterns in the relationships between different asset classes.
- A classic example would be the relationship between stocks and bonds. Typically during periods when stocks are performing well, bonds will perform poorly. Conversely when bonds are performing poorly stocks typically perform well.
- This relationship between stocks and bonds would be known as an inverse correlation.
  | Asset Class | Return | Risk | Equities | Cash | Bonds | Real Estate |
  | ----------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ----- | ----- | ----------- |
  | Equities | 11.45% | 17.78% | 1 | -0.2 | -0.02 | 0.68 |
  | Cash | 2.21% | 2.16% | -0.2 | 1 | 0.17 | -0.18 |
  | Bonds | 4.69% | 4.74% | -0.02 | 0.17 | 1 | 0.39 |
  | Real Estate | 10.91% | 19.22% | 0.68 | -0.18 | 0.39 | 1 |

- The table above shows the historical return and risk of the four most common asset classes over the past 30 years.
- There are two key takeaways from looking at this historical data
  - Assets that have historically higher returns like stocks and real estate also have a much higher risk — they may increase 40% one year and decrease 30% the next year. Assets like bonds or cash are much less risky but also have lower expected returns.
  - To achieve a diversified portfolio, it is important to invest in asset classes that are inversely correlated.

## How does Diversification work?

- By diversifying a portfolio across multiple different asset classes, an investor can lower the overall risk of their portfolio without meaningful decreasing their expected return.
- To illustrate the benefits of diversification, we’ll look at two example portfolios and how they would have performed over the past 30 years.
- Alice invests $10,000 in 1994 in an allocation of 100% equities.
  - Today, Alice has $154,000 and has achieved an average return of 10.2%. However, during 2008 her portfolio declined over 50% in value.
- Bob invests $10,000 in 1994 in an allocation of 50% equities, 30% bonds, 20% real estate
  - Today, Bob has $111,000 and has achieved an average return of 8.9%. During 2008 his diversified portfolio declined \*\*\*\*39%.
- Clearly, in hindsight, you would prefer Alice’s allocation, but Bob was able to achieve almost the same return (8.9% vs 10.2%) with roughly 40% less risk.
- Which would you choose?

## Asset Allocation and Macroeconomics

- We’ve seen how diversification can improve risk-adjusted returns and help buffer large macroeconomic events like the stock market crash of 2000 or the real estate bubble of 2008.
- Asset allocation is also a key way to prepare for any set of unknown economic circumstances.
- Ray Dalio, the legendary hedge fund investor at the firm Bridgewater, has a simplified model that breaks down 4 unique economic regimes and the asset classes that have historically performed well under each.
  - Positive growth, economic expansion - equities
  - Negative growth, economic contraction - bonds / treasuries / low risk real estate
  - Rising prices, inflation - gold and other commodities
  - Falling prices, deflation - bonds, low-risk stocks that pay dividends
- This approach is referred to as an “All Weather” approach and is intended to provide positive performance from at least part of an investor's portfolio regardless of the macroeconomic circumstances.

## Examples of Common Allocations

- Age-Adjusted Equities/Bonds - If you have a 401k or IRA that is on “auto-pilot” it likely does some sort of age adjusting of equities and bonds. The standard formula is 100 - (Age) = % of portfolio you should allocate to bonds. A 20-year-old, would therefore invest 80% in the risker asset class of equities and have 20% in less risky bonds. As they approach retirement this mix would flip as the focus of the portfolio becomes less about growth and more about wealth preservation.
- Lazy Portfolio - 1/3 bonds, 1/3 international stocks, 1/3 US stocks. This allocation has the advantage of being static and easy to implement at most any major brokerage.
- All-Weather Allocation - 30% stocks, 55% bonds, 15% gold + commodities. As mentioned above, this allocation was developed by the hedge fund Bridgewater to weather any unknown economic condition.

## Future Considerations

- Asset allocation and diversification are not magic bullets.
- Like all models that rely on historical data, how applicable the concepts will be going forward is unknown. We only have ~50 years of good historical data on asset class performance (for crypto it's only ~5).
- The world in 2022 looks very different than at any other point over the last 100 years. Technology has interconnected our lives and our financial system in ways that have myriad unintended consequences. Interest rates (the rate at which individuals and businesses can borrow money) have been at historic lows for nearly a decade. Basic assumptions like “The US dollar is the world’s reserve currency” are being challenged by geopolitical events.
- One concrete observation of the last 10 years is that stocks and bonds are no longer as inversely correlated as they once were. As a result, it is not a certainty that in future stock downturns bonds can provide investors with the same lifeboat they have in the past.
- To further complicate things, with incredibly low interest rates and high inflation, investing in bonds, in general, is a risky proposition. Earning a guaranteed 2-3% return may sound enticing until you realize that a $100 item may cost $108 next year after 8% inflation.

## Closing Thoughts

- Perhaps the most tangible benefit of asset allocation is it encourages long-term thinking about your investments. Myriad [studies](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/your-money/stocks-and-bonds/the-illogic-of-active-trading.html#:~:text=A%20series%20of%20academic%20studies,return%20is%20likely%20to%20be.) have confirmed that the more an investor trades, attempting to beat the market by picking winners and losers, the less likely they are to outperform the investor that simply buys and holds.
- Asset allocation is about setting a plan and then slowly rebalancing a portfolio as certain asset classes perform well and others perform poorly.
- Having a firm understanding of the core principles discussed here will help you better understand the investments you’re making, hopefully, help lower your overall portfolio risk and prepare for any unknown economic environment.
